    <h2>The Pressure of Expectations</h2>
    <p>Today’s youth are under immense pressure — from academics, family expectations, career uncertainty, and even the constant comparison on social media. This unrealistic competition creates a sense of failure even before life has truly begun.</p>
    
    <h2>The Illusion of Instant Success</h2>
    <p>With influencers, overnight millionaires, and curated success stories, young people start believing that life should be fast-tracked. When reality does not match these illusions, frustration kicks in, making them feel life is already over.</p>
    
    <h2>The Lack of Emotional Support</h2>
    <p>Despite being more connected digitally, real emotional support has decreased. Many youths feel unheard or judged when they express struggles, leaving them isolated with their emotions.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Overcome This</h2>
    <p>It’s important to slow down, embrace small wins, and understand that life is a journey, not a race. Building resilience, seeking genuine support, and focusing on self-growth instead of comparisons can ease this frustration.</p>
